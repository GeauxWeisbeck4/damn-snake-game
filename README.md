# damn-snake-game
My rendition of the classic Snake Game, where a Turtle Art version of a snake eats an apple and you score points. Game ends when you run into snake or wall. It's actually exactly like the snake game - I just call it the "Damn Snake Game" so it's like my version of it. Don't worry, I didn't copyright that or anything if you want to use it too.

This was an interesting rendition of making the "Damn Snake Game". I had made this game before with HTML and JavaScript years ago because I wanted to play it, which is interesting because at the time I was learning Python - go figure. But I learned this way from Angela Yu's 100 Days of Projects Python Bootcamp (which I can't recommend enough) and was really easy to make. This version was made using Turtle. I was surprised because I woulda guessed it woulda just been made with Pygame, but it actually works great for the art. 

This is one of the Python projects that didn't get swept away last year when I cleaned my Windows PC - I'm rebuilding and still recovering some files but this is probably my most complete project I have on GitHub for Python right now.
